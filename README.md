### How to play ?

Get some fun company first. One of the players creates a room for everyone, indicating the number of words and the time that will be allotted to explain them. The rest of the players join the game by entering a code that will be communicated by the room creator.

The device of each player records the answers of the participant. The one who answered correctly and was faster than the others gets points for each guessed word.

Feature: Target on the guessing game screen displays semantic proximity of response attempts to a trapped word.

After the word has been guessed, the presenter explains the meaning of the next and so on until the time runs out. The leader can "Skip" the word or press "The word is right" and choose the participant who gave the right answer.

The one with the most points wins.
